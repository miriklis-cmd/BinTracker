# BinTracker Automated Testing

BinTracker uses separate unit and SQLite integration test projects.

## Unit tests

`tests/BinTracker.UnitTests`

Business-rule and regression coverage includes customer identity, balances, import planning/reconciliation, Market Floor rules/layout policy and other non-database logic.

## Integration tests

`tests/BinTracker.IntegrationTests`

Database-backed coverage includes schema upgrades, movement/balance behaviour and transactional importer behaviour.

## Regression rule

When a real defect is found:

1. reproduce it with an automated test where practical;
2. fix the defect;
3. keep the regression test permanently.

## Current high-value gaps

- failure injection proving Import transaction rollback;
- changed-workbook replacement workflow once implemented;
- more production-scale/custom workbook fixtures without private business data;
- Release-build acceptance;
- stress coverage for high-density Market Floor days.

## Local validation

Run:

```powershell
.\Build-BinTracker.bat
```

A local candidate is valid only when restore, build and automated tests all succeed with zero warnings.
